# This is an SAMPLE of what your "credentials" json file will look like.
# To acquire this file you should create a project for the Google Sheets and Google Drive API and then create a service account.
# After you have created your service account, select "add key", and download the key as a json file.
# Then rename the file to "credentials.json" and make sure it is in the same folder as the main.py file to make the code work.
